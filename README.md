## I will not be held responsible for usage of this program.

To install and run, make sure you have dotnet core installed. Then, using the CLI, run `dotnet restore`

If you have Visual Studio, this might be done for you.

### Info

I decided to slap this on here because I saw [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzedMdx6QG4) but saw no published code. As far as I can tell, this is basically it. I slightly modified it to work with my environment / sense of humor. I also added a few comments along the way. I consider this a C# learning project for me. Please use responsibly. 


### Run

Fill out empty info in the .cs file. 

Run Commands
```
dotnet restore
