## Info

I decided to slap this on here because I saw [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzedMdx6QG4) but saw no published code. As far as I can tell, this is basically it. I slightly modified it to work with my environment / sense of humor. I also added a few comments along the way. I consider this a C# learning project for me. Please use responsibly.
